Welcome to my final project of Programming 4. This is an exam exercise for Graduaat programmeren in Arteveldehogeschool.  
Here we learned how to use React and Strapi for our front and back end, we also used Tanstack for our routing.

You can also launch it locally:

Website: use `cd client` to go into the folder, then use `npm i` to update the packages. Then finally use `npm run dev` to launch.  
Database: use `cd server` to go into the folder, then use `npm i` to update the packages. Then finally use `npm run develop` to launch.

Have fun with this Kanban-style task manager!
